This dataset is a snapshot of a fictional retail landscape, capturing essential attributes that drive retail operations and customer interactions. It includes key details such as Transaction ID, Date, Customer ID, Gender, Age, Product Category, Quantity, Price per Unit, and Total Amount. These attributes enable a multifaceted exploration of sales trends, demographic influences, and purchasing behaviors.

### 2.  Sales Performance by Quarter

Each quarter is analyzed using column charts to show the number of units sold in each category. The visuals are enhanced with slicers, allowing for interactive filtering of quarters, enabling users to view and compare category-wise performance for each quarter individually.

#### Insights :

- The gap between the top (Clothing) and bottom (Electronics) performers highlights an opportunity to explore why Electronics underperformed in Q1 ‚Äî possibly price sensitivity or lack of deals.

- The total sales in Q1 suggest a strong start to the year, with all three categories contributing significantly.

- Future quarters can be compared using the slicer to identify trends or shifts in customer preference across seasons.

### 3. Sales by Day of the Week
This bar chart displays day-wise sales performance across the days of the week for the month of February. The data highlights how sales vary from Sunday to Saturday, with each bar representing the total sales value (‚Çπ) for that specific day. The slicer on the right allows month-wise filtering, providing the ability to track and compare performance trends across different time periods.

#### Insights : 
- Friday spikes might be linked to end-of-week shopping behavior, payday effects, or targeted offers.

- The Monday bump could suggest online promotions or start-of-week incentives.

- Thursday underperformance offers a chance to introduce weekday-specific deals or push notifications to boost engagement.

### 4. Sales by Gender (2023)
This clustered column chart presents the percentage of unit sales by gender across three product categories: Beauty, Clothing, and Electronics. It compares the buying patterns of Female (green) and Male (orange) customers, helping to understand how each gender contributes to sales across different product segments.

![Alt Image](/Assests/sales_gender.png)

#### Insights : 
- The gender gap is minimal across all categories, suggesting well-distributed marketing efforts or diverse product appeal.

- Clothing and Electronics show nearly equal interest from both genders ‚Äî these categories are ideal for broad-based promotional campaigns.

- Beauty leans slightly toward female buyers, but male participation is still noteworthy and should not be overlooked.
